"""
Now, you can add test cases for the functions you want to test. Here are some examples of test cases you might consider adding:

    test_load_extracted_files: Test if the function can load the extracted files information from a JSON file correctly. You can create a temporary JSON file with some sample data and check if the function loads it as expected.

    test_save_extracted_files: Test if the function can save the extracted files information to a JSON file correctly. You can create a sample dictionary with extracted files information and save it using the function. Then, load the saved JSON file and check if the data matches the original dictionary.

    test_extract_rar: Test if the extract_rar function in the WatcherEventHandler class can extract RAR files properly. You can create a temporary RAR file with some sample data and check if the function extracts the files as expected.

Please note that you might need to adjust your watchrarr.py script to make it more testable (e.g., by making some functions or variables accessible from the outside).
